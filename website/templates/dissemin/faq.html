                       Librarians around the world cannot check whether all the papers in a given journal are available on homepages: in doubt, they subscribe to this journal to make sure their researchers have access to it. This costs a lot of money for research institutions. Papers stored in repositories are <strong>easier to detect</strong> and can help academia save money.

                    In most cases, the errors that you see on Dissemin have not been introduced by Dissemin, but are already present in the <a href="{{ sources_url }}">public sources</a> that Dissemin harvests. Hence, please first check if the error that you have seen is already present in our data sources, by looking at the "Links" section in the top right of the page. If one of these pages contain the error, you should report the problem to them and not to us, otherwise the mistake will persist in the source.

Note that yo cannot yet fix the problem yourself, although we hope in the longer term to develop a system to allow our users to edit details of their papers themselves.

                    First, note that Dissemin does not account for copies of articles that are only available on a personal homepage or a similar website. This is deliberate, because we believe that <a href="#repositoriesRock">articles should be hosted in repositories</a>.

                    Second, at the moment, Dissemin only supports repositories with a crawlable API that follows the <a href="https://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html">OAI-PMH protocol</a>, and is <a href="https://www.base-search.net/about/en/suggest.php">registered</a> in <a href="https://www.base-search.net/">BASE</a>. We have a <a href="https://github.com/dissemin/croawl">long-term project</a> to support more repositories by crawling them, but for the moment, we do not have the resources to support repositories not covered by BASE. Hence, if you are a user of a repository and would like it to be supported by Dissemin, please contact the repository administrator and suggest them to implement OAI-PMH support and to <a href="https://www.base-search.net/about/en/suggest.php">register</a> their repository in BASE.

                    Authenticating users is necessary to deposit papers on their behalf in open repositories. Besides, knowing a user's ORCID id helps us find its publications, avoiding articles authored by namesakes for instance. Logging in via ORCID will not expose any private information to Dissemin: we only have access to the public part of your ORCID record. For instance, unless you have explicitly marked your email address as public, we do not even know your email address when you log in to Dissemin via ORCID.

                    Nothing. When you log in via ORCID to Dissemin, this does not grant us any permission to change anything in your ORCID record.

                {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                    ORCID supports various methods to claim publications. Our preferred one is via CrossRef's search interface. Here is how to use it:
                {% endblocktrans %}
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                        Go to <a href="https://search.crossref.org/">CrossRef Metadata Search</a>;

                <li>
                    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                        Click "Log in" in the top right corner and go through the ORCID login process;
                    {% endblocktrans %}
                </li>
                <li>
                    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                        Search for your publications, for instance by typing your name in CrossRef's search interface;
                    {% endblocktrans %}
                </li>
                <li>
                    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                        Add publications that are yours to your ORCID record by clicking "Add to ORCID".
                    {% endblocktrans %}
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                    You can also add publications to your profile <em>on Dissemin</em>, by clicking the button "Include in my profile" in search results on Dissemin. (This button is only visible when you are logged in, and next to papers that Dissemin thinks you have authored.) You can also exclude articles from your profile in this way. Please note that these changes are local to Dissemin and are <em>not</em> propagated to your ORCID profile, because ORCID does not have a free API allowing us to propagate them.

            <h3 id="orcidUpdate">{% trans "My ORCID details on Dissemin are outdated." %}</h3>

            <p>
                {% blocktrans trimmed %}
                    If you change some details in your ORCID profile (name, homepage, etc.), the changes will not automatically be picked up in your profile on Dissemin. To update your profile on Dissemin accordingly, once you have logged in to Dissemin, you can go to your <a href="/my-profile">profile page</a> and click "Refresh publications".
