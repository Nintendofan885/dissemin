Dissemin not just detects papers behind paywalls, it offers solutions to liberate them.
To achieve this goal with few effort for scientists, they can directly upload a publication into an open repository.
Near the big repositories Zenodo and HAL, they can deposit publications in institutional repositories.
This and the following pages will give you some information at hand how you can add your institutional repository to Dissemin.

As you will learn, this involves not to much effort.
First, we describe the workflow and how the document finds it way into your repository.
Then we explain our metadata, services and give an outline of how we guide you through the integration process.
In a last step we dive into more technical topics, giving precise descriptions of the metadata encoding and how to transfer the file with its metadata.
