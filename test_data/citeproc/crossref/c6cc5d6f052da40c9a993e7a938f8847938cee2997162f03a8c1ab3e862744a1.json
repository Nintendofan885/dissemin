The authors will delineate the benefits of collaboration between the concept of Social Networking and the process of KM. With the advent of Web 2.0 technologies, it is a natural evolutionary outcome that SNs have driven the advancement of KM, and conversely KM has driven the advancement of SNs. In certain instances, SNs and KM have a symbiotic relationship whereby one cannot exist without the other. Moreover, an impact analysis will be performed to show that while SNs are an outcome of KM, both require each other in order to succeed where Social Software fits. This chapter is particularly intended to cater to the needs of librarians in a corporate environment and to show the impact and benefits of SNs and KM in the information world.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4018\/978-1-61350-195-5.ch004","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,7,8]],"date-time":"2013-07-08T12:09:06Z","timestamp":1373285346000},"page":"64-83","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Social Networks and Knowledge Management"],"prefix":"10.4018","author":[{"given":"Bhojaraju","family":"Gunjal","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Mysore, India"}]},{"given":"Panorea","family":"Gaitanou","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Ionian University, Greece"}]},{"given":"Sarah","family":"Yasin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"YBP Library Services, USA"}]}],"member":"2432","reference":[{"issue":"1","key":"978-1-61350-195-5.ch004.-1","first-page":"1","article-title":"At the crossroads of knowledge management with social software electronic.","volume":"4","author":"G.Avram","year":"2006","journal-title":"Journal of Knowledge Management"},{"key":"978-1-61350-195-5.ch004.-2","unstructured":"Berlin, E.

The proper planned training and skill development for all stakeholders by mentors to train both staff and users are some of the issues that need to be considered to enhance the RDM process. An effort will be also made to present the suitable policies and workflows along with the adoption of best practices in RDM, so as to boost the research process in an organisation. This study will showcase the implementation of RDM processes in the Higher Educational Institute of India, referring particularly to the Central Library @ NIT Rourkela in Odisha, India with a proposed framework.
