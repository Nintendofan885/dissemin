The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the acute effect (up to 1 month) of teriparatide (TPTD; human recombinant PTH 1\u201334) on serum levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator for nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) in women with established osteoporosis.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Design<\/jats:title><jats:p>Twenty-three postmenopausal Caucasian women with established osteoporosis (mean age 66.7\u00b11.6 years) received daily injections of 20\u200a\u03bcg TPTD for 12 months.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>Serum samples for total calcium (Ca), phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen, intact PTH (iPTH), OPG, and RANKL were obtained at baseline, 1\u200ah, 1 day, and 1 month after initiation of therapy.
