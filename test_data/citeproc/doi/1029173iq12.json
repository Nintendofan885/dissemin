Furthermore, it will describe several tendencies concerning the management of repository tools for research data, as well as the challenges in implementing the RDM. The proper planned training and skill development for all stakeholders by mentors to train both staff and users are some of the issues that need to be considered to enhance the RDM process. An effort will be also made to present the suitable policies and workflows along with the adoption of best practices in RDM, so as to boost the research process in an organisation. This study will showcase the implementation of RDM processes in the Higher Educational Institute of India, referring particularly to the Central Library @ NIT Rourkela in Odisha, India with a proposed framework. Finally, this study will also propose an area of opportunities that can boost research activities in the Institute.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.29173\/iq12","type":"article-journal","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,16]],"date-time":"2018-03-16T22:32:19Z","timestamp":1521239539000},"page":"12","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Research Data Management: A proposed framework to boost research in Higher Educational Institutes.","prefix":"10.29173","volume":"41","author":[{"given":"Bhojaraju","family":"Gunjal","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Panorea","family":"Gaitanou","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"11723","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,10]]},"container-title":"IASSIST Quarterly","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.iassistquarterly.com\/index.php\/iassist\/article\/download\/12\/6","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.iassistquarterly.com\/index.php\/iassist\/article\/download\/12\/6","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]],"date-time":"2019-11-21T13:10:38Z","timestamp":1574341838000},"score":1.0,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,10]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"published-online":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,10]]},"issue":"1-4"},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.29173\/iq12","relation":{},"ISSN":["0739-1137","0739-1137"],"container-title-short":"IQ"}
