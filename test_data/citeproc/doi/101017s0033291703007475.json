The schizophrenia and major depression groups did not differ significantly from the control group.

It is also shown by comparison with previous work, that high strength stimuli more effectively distinguish bipolar from control subjects than low strength stimuli. The data on schizophrenia and major depression suggest the need for large-scale specificity trials. Further study is also required to assess genetic and pathophysiological factors as well as the potential effects of state, medication, and clinical and biological subtypes.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/s0033291703007475","type":"article-journal","created":{"date-parts":[[2003,5,13]],"date-time":"2003-05-13T16:30:34Z","timestamp":1052843434000},"page":"683-692","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":40,"title":"Slow binocular rivalry in bipolar disorder","prefix":"10.1017","volume":"33","author":[{"given":"S.
